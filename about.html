        <h2>About Me</h2>
        My journey in the music industry has equipped me with a keen eye for detail, a deep understanding of complex systems, and the ability to adapt quickly to new technologies. 
        These skills seamlessly translate into my role as a data analyst, where I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover actionable insights and solve real-world problems.
        <br>
        <p> 
        My key skills include:
        <br>
        •	Extracting meaningful insights from large amounts of data using Microsoft Excel, Python and SQL.
        <br>
        •	Identifying trends and making predictions using machine learning and deep learning techniques in Python. 
        <br>
        •	Creating compelling visuals and dashboards using Tableau. 
        </p>
         I am available for full-time or freelance work, either in the Berlin area or remotely.

        <br>
        When I'm not busy crunching numbers and fine-tuning algorithms, I can be found running, spending time with my cat or digging for obscure gems at the many local record stores.
