    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I grew up with a musical background, playing violin for the first half of my life before diving headfirst into the world of electronic music. Working as an artist, producer and occasional sound-designer meant learning the many ways to translate wave-forms into music and optimize signal flows and parameters to find the best sound possible. 
    </p>
    <p> 
    After over a decade in the industry, I felt it was time to explore new territories. Using technology to uncover insights from data seemed like the ideal next step to take. <br>
    In a relatively short period of time, I managed to learn the fundamentals of data analytics, as well as languages like Python and SQL, visualization skills on Tableau and more ways to use our old friend Microsoft Excel. I also found myself dusting off math concepts I had banished to the dark corners of my mind after finishing high-school, never expecting to have any use for them in real life (oh, how I ate my words).
    </p>
    <p> 
    As a data analyst, I am ready to transform raw data into insights that make sense and to communicate my findings in a clear, visually-compelling way to engage stakeholders and fellow nerds alike. I look forward to continuing the learning process in this field as I grow and further explore the world of data. 
    </p>
    <p> 
     I am available for full-time or freelance work, either in the Berlin area or remotely.

    </p>
    <p>
    When I'm not busy crunching numbers and fine-tuning algorithms, I can be found running, playing records, tinkering with synthesizers in my home studio and spending time with my cat.
